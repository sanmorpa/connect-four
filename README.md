# Connect-four
## Description
A connect-four game with a simple AI. It has been developped in python and has terminal graphics. You can either play against a bot, against another player or just see a match between two bots. There's options for the difficulty level as well, which determines how "intelligent" the robots will be. Another functionality is the fact that by typing "help" ot "h", you can get a prediction from an "Oracle", that will let you know which are your options of winning on each row.

Right now I'm working on making the last part of the game: a simple AI for the bots and the player's oracle.

RIVAL OPTIONS:
1. Bot vs Bot. Two "highly intelligent" bots will play against each other... Who will win? Little Robot or Huge Robot?
2. Bot vs Player. Play against Little Robot, the best conenct-four player on the galaxy!
3. Player vs Player. Play against a friend!

DIFFICULTY OPTIONS:
1. Easy. Play against a random bot
2. Medium. Play against a bot that knows what it's doing (more or less)
3. Difficult. Play against an AI bot that will try to win.

This is my solution to the guided proyect presented by Keepcoding®'s course "Curso Resolución de Problemas con OOP y TDD - Introducción IA y Machine Learning".
