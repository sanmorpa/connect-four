# Connect-four
## Description
A simple connect-four game with a simple AI. This is a simple game developped in python and with terminal graphics. You can either play against a robot, against another player or just see a match between two robots. There's options for the difficulty level as well, which determines how "intelligent" the robots will be. Another functionality is the fact that by typing "help" ot "h", you can get a prediction from an "Oracle", that will let you know which are your options of winning on each row.

This is my solution to the guided proyect presented by Keepcoding®'s course "Curso Resolución de Problemas con OOP y TDD - Introducción IA y Machine Learning".
